<pre>Hi, Yura.


A number of OWLNext list subscribers expressed interest in a 
fairly generic set of OWL-based classes I have; TVCLFormWrapper, 
TVCLDialogView, and TVCLInputFileDocument; for working with VCL dialogs, 
views, and documents.
I had suggested that if there's general interest, we could add these 
to OWLNext.

Looking at the code more closely, I see it's not quite general 
or abstract enough to become an part of OWL NExt.  It needs to be 
customized for individual DLLs from VCL.  Right now I don't have the 
time to do much more work on it, so I'm providing it "as is" in case 
you'd like to post it to the OWL NExt web site as a example for others 
to use.  (And maybe this e-mail message should accompany it to help 
provide some background).

The attached file contains a set of projects demonstrating how to 
create an OWL MDI Doc/View application using VCL form view and 
document classes in a DLL.  The view I included is not sizable -- 
it has a fixed border.  It isn't too much trouble to make it a sizable 
window.  User's can let me know if they need more details on this.

By extension, this also demonstrates showing a non-modal VCL dialog 
box from the OWL app. Showing a modal dialog is a fairly simple subset 
of this.

The ReadMe file gives some details.

I hope people will send me any improvements or bug fixes they make 
to these files.

Also, please be aware:  I've had a user report an intermittent crash 
with one of my applications that uses these OWL-VCL doc-view classes.
The reports I've had suggest that the problem *might* be with these 
classes, probably on the VCL (DLL) side.  If other developers' tests 
reveal similar problems, I'd like to know. I'd be happy to work together 
to figure out what might be wrong.  And I'd *definitely* appreciate it 
if they send me any bug fixes they might make. :-)

Regards.
Greg
