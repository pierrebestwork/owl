Freeware OWL classes that show items with a checkmark in a listbox.
The TCheckListBox and TCheckListBoxItem classes are similar to original OWL
classes, but they are buggy free, look better and have more functions.

TCheckListBox
-------------
- Similar to Borlands TCheckList, but it's buggy free
- Use the system highlight color for selected items
- Add, Insert, Find and Delete items on the fly
- The items in the list can be sorted
- The text of the items can be shown with tab stops

TCheckListBoxItem
-----------------
- Similar to Borlands TCheckListItem, but it's buggy free
- The checkbox of the item can be disabled
- Draws the checkbox like Windows (16-bit and 32-bit)
- Has comparison operators and copy constructor
- Has more information functions

The example "CheckLstApp" use the CheckLst classes and shows
you all the functions of TCheckListBox and TCheckListBoxItem.

V1.1 is tested with Borland C++ 5.02, OWL 5.02 under Windows NT 4.0 SP3
and V1.0 is also tested with Borland C++ 4.52, OWL 2.5 under Windows 3.11

Many thanks to Torsten Schmeissel for their help
in testing and fixing the CheckList classes.
