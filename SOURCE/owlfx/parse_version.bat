: 
:   define _OWLFX_VERSION(v) v(Major,Minor,Revision,Build)
: 
: In the for-body (echo command) the following variables are defined:
: 
:   %%i = Major
:   %%j = Minor
:   %%k = Revision
:   %%l = Build
:
: The parsed version number is assigned to the OWLVER environment variable and written 
: to a temporary file "%TEMP%\owlver.tmp" with the following contents:
:
:   OWLVER=%OWLVER%
:
: The temporary file can be used by makefiles to include the OWLNext version number.
